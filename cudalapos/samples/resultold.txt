The/DT involvement/NN of/IN ion/NN channels/NNS in/IN B/NNP and/CC T/NNP lymphocyte/NN activation/NN is/VBZ supported/VBN by/IN many/JJ reports/NNS of/IN changes/NNS in/IN ion/NN fluxes/NNS and/CC membrane/NN potential/JJ after/IN mitogen/JJ binding/NN ./.
Human/NNP T/NNP and/CC B/NNP lymphocytes/NNS demonstrate/VBP an/DT early/JJ and/CC transient/JJ hyperpolarization/NN after/IN ligand/NN binding/NN ./.
Inasmuch/RB as/IN the/DT change/NN in/IN membrane/NN potential/NN is/VBZ dependent/JJ on/IN elevation/NN of/IN free/JJ cytosolic/JJ calcium/NN ,/, the/DT hyperpolarization/NN is/VBZ presumably/RB through/IN opening/NN of/IN Ca/NNP (/-LRB- 2+/CD )/-RRB- -stimulated/JJ K+/NNP channels/NNS ./.
We/PRP have/VBP used/VBN charybdotoxin/NN ,/, a/DT known/VBN inhibitor/NN of/IN Ca/NNP (/-LRB- 2+/CD )/-RRB- -dependent/JJ K+/NNP channels/NNS ,/, to/TO study/VB the/DT role/NN of/IN these/DT channels/NNS in/IN lymphocyte/JJ activation/NN and/CC mitogenesis/NN ./.
