The/PRP involvement/VBN of/NNS ion/CD channels/VBG in/DT B/NNP and/NN T/WDT lymphocyte/DT activation/IN is/CC supported/CD by/IN many/JJ reports/VBZ of/NNS changes/VBZ in/RBR ion/CD fluxes/NNPS and/RB membrane/DT potential/JJ after/IN mitogen/DT binding/VBG ./PRP
Human/NNP T/$ and/VBD B/NNP lymphocytes/$ demonstrate/VBP an/NN early/JJ and/RB transient/JJ hyperpolarization/JJ after/VBD ligand/JJR binding/VBG ./PRP
